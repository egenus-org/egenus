## About egenus

egenus aims to help homeless and vulnerable people, who often fall through the social safety net, to participate in the digital world. Implemented as a map-based application, it provides users with accessible assistance services in their vicinity. This project was conceived as part of the project module of the Media Informatics program at the Berlin University of Applied Sciences in 2024.
